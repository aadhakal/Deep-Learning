# Project 4: Autoencoders and Representation Learning

This project implements and explores autoencoders for dimensionality reduction and representation learning. The goal is to understand how autoencoders compress information into lower-dimensional latent spaces and reconstruct the original data through experimentation and analysis.

---

## Overview

Implemented from scratch using PyTorch, this project includes:

- Basic autoencoder architecture with configurable latent dimensions
- Experiments with different latent space sizes (2, 8, 32, 64)
- Training and evaluation on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset
- Visualization and analysis of reconstructed images

All results are supported by **plots**, **discussion**, and **analysis** included in the accompanying notebook or report.

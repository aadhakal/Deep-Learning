# Deep Learning Projects

Hi there! I'm a curious builder with a passion for making machines a little smarter â€” and maybe even teaching them to write better code than I can (still working on that part).

This repository is a collection of deep learning projects I've implemented as part of my CS coursework, research, and late-night experiments with coffee and curiosity as my best friends.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects

---

### ðŸ”¹ [Project 1: Modern Recurrent Neural Networks](./Modern%20RNN)
> **Theme:** "Backprop through time, one vanishing gradient at a time."

- Implemented basic RNNs and GRUs using PyTorch
- Explored hyperparameter tuning, gradient clipping, and ReLU activation
- Conducted ablation studies to understand how GRU gates affect performance
- Trained on H.G. Wells' *The Time Machine* â€” which feels poetic, really

---

### ðŸ”¹ [Project 3: Attention Mechanisms and Sequence-to-Sequence Models](./Project3)
> **Theme:** "Teaching neural networks where to look."

- Implemented additive (Bahdanau) attention mechanism from scratch
- Built attention-based sequence-to-sequence models for machine translation
- Visualized attention weights to understand model focus during translation
- Evaluated translation quality using BLEU scores across configurations

---

### ðŸ”¹ [Project 4: Autoencoders and Representation Learning](./Project4)
> **Theme:** "Compressing reality into lower dimensions."

- Built autoencoder architectures with configurable latent dimensions
- Experimented with different latent space sizes (2, 8, 32, 64)
- Analyzed the trade-off between compression and reconstruction quality
- Visualized how increasing latent dimensions improves image reconstruction

---

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies

- Python, NumPy, PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebook, Matplotlib  
- Git, GitHub

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Repo Exists

- To get my hands dirty implementing everything from the ground up
- To deeply understand how and why deep learning models work
- To develop strong debugging, experimentation, and research skills
- To document it all for the future reference

## ðŸ“¬ Let's Connect

If you're working on cool things in AI, education, or robotics â€” or just want to chat tech, coffee, or build ideas â€” I'd love to connect.

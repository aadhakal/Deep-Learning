# Deep Learning Projects

Hi there! I'm a curious builder with a passion for making machines a little smarter — and maybe even teaching them to write better code than I can (still working on that part).

This repository is a collection of deep learning projects I've implemented as part of my CS coursework, research, and late-night experiments with coffee and curiosity as my best friends.

## 📂 Projects

---

### 🔹 [Project 1: Modern Recurrent Neural Networks](./Modern%20RNN)
> **Theme:** “Backprop through time, one vanishing gradient at a time.”

- Implemented basic RNNs and GRUs using PyTorch
- Explored hyperparameter tuning, gradient clipping, and ReLU activation
- Conducted ablation studies to understand how GRU gates affect performance
- Trained on H.G. Wells' *The Time Machine* — which feels poetic, really

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- Python, NumPy, PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebook, Matplotlib  
- Git, GitHub

---

## 🎯 Why This Repo Exists

- To get my hands dirty implementing everything from the ground up
- To deeply understand how and why deep learning models work
- To develop strong debugging, experimentation, and research skills
- To document it all for the future reference

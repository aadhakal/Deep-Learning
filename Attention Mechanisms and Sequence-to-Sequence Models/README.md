# Project 3: Attention Mechanisms and Sequence-to-Sequence Models

This project implements and explores attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models for machine translation tasks. The goal is to understand how attention mechanisms improve neural machine translation performance through experimentation and analysis.

---

## Overview

Implemented from scratch using PyTorch, this project includes:

- Additive (Bahdanau) attention mechanism implementation
- Attention-based sequence-to-sequence model for machine translation
- Hyperparameter tuning and model optimization
- Visualization and analysis of attention weights

All results are supported by **plots**, **discussion**, and **analysis** included in the accompanying notebook or report.
